# AlphaVantage

Need:
- make interfaces for structs, to enable marshalling
  - or better?
- reformat functions to accept interfaces, which each API can satisfy
- save all ticker data in single file, instead of split by dates

Possible:
- output csv?
- output into posgres?

Not:
- for doing further analytics, this is just for data cleaning/accessing
